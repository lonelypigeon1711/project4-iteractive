    <h1>Project 4: Iterative Design</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        For this project, our group has created an interactive interface for a selected startup. 
        Understanding the goals of the startup, we have designed our interface to meet the needs of our "client".
        Bloom is a savings account that allows East Africans to save their money in USD without being subject to any local inflation. 
        Users can continue to spend money in their current currencies. 
        This service protects users from losing their savings due to local inflation.
        Since many financial transactions are already made on mobile devices, we plan on designing our interface for a mobile device.  
        </p>

        <h2>4 Sets of Initial Sketches </h2>
        <p>Thinking about the goals of the startup, our team created the following sketches. </p>

        <h2>Wireframe from Combined Ideas</h2>
        <p>After looking at our combined designs, we took the best of each to make the following designs.</p>

        <h2>Interactive Hi-Fi Mockup with Critique Feedback</h2>
        <p> After creating our high-fi prototypes, we had fellow students critque our work. 
        We received several recommendations that were very helpful in understanding how to better our interface. 
        Some were more logical, like adding a way to log out, or adding clear buttons to homepages. 
        But other critics discussed changing color for accessibility and adding search elements. </p>

        <h2>User Testing Results & Analysis</h2>
        <p>The users gave us really valuable feedback. 
            Something that came up in almost each of the videos was the toggle between USD and SDG. 
            The users expressed their dislike of the drag. 
            They mentioned their desire for it to be simplified to a click option. 
            Additionally, some of our tasks could have been more specific. 
            When dealing with someone who doesn't understand our project or know about our startup, we have to remember to explain everything as concisely and specifically as possible. 
            Otherwise, things can get lost in translation.
            Overall, this feedback was very helpful, and if we were doing another iteration of the prototype we would implement their suggestions.
